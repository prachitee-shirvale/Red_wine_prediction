# Red_wine_quality_prediction

Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties.
This model predicts the quality of wine based on its ingradients.

## The features (Independent variables)
1. Fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
2. Volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
3. Citric acid (g / dm^3)
4. Residual sugar (g / dm^3)
5. Chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
6. Free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
7. Total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
8. Density (g / cm^3)
9. pH
10. Sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
11. Alcohol (% by volume)

## The Target Variable(Dependent Feature)

12. Quality (Score between 0 and 10)


### Impact of features involved on its quality
1. fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

2. volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

3. citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

4. residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

5. chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

6. free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

7. total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

8. density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

9. pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

10. sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

11. alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine
